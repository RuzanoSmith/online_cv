<p1> As a highly motivated and ambitious student I am eager to gain an in depth knowledge of IT within the industrial world. While at Ashmole Academy I studied IT from years 7 to 9 however I was not given the opportunity to pursue the subject any further. Still, my interest for IT and technology stayed strong. I enjoy IT as it broadens the way we work, live and even gives us glimpses into a better future with advanced technology. I believe that technology is our path forward whether it is hardware or software advances, the world would not be able to achieve such astounding leaps without its help. Within a team environment my skills of leadership and communication prove to be very useful in reaching the final product of a task. I also work effectively alone and will strive for the best results in all projects.
    An apprenticeship is my path forward into a great IT and technology career which is the main reason why I want to join your apprenticeship program. It will give me the experience required so I can get into this field with the knowledge to develop projects to a better standard than most people entering this sector.
    My knowledge of computers and different programming systems would enable me to learn new complex software quickly. In addition my willingness to learn new things and expand the skill set I already have, will aid in my drive for success.  As a hardworking learner, I put my utmost efforts into tackling problems. This apprenticeship will be a massive step in the right direction as it would give me the experience and the vital skills I require to get my dream job. A start towards a successful IT career is what I aim to gain by getting this apprenticeship which will help give me the experience I require for my career ahead. Other than focusing on my studies I find pleasure in staying up to date about technology via BBC’s ‘Click’ program and ‘Wired’. Excellence is always my aim in all activities I complete.
