    <h1> Past work experience </h1>

<p> At UCL ophthalmology I assisted with the carefully controlled samples of mouse tissue with tumours for viewing and adding a radioactive element so they can view the tumour using an element tracer. In addition I took part in observing and noting down the impacts these tumours had on the surrounding blood vessel using a computer powered microscope. </p>
