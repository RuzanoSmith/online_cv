    <h1> Past work experience </h1>

<p> At UCL ophthalmology I assisted with the carefully controlled samples of mouse tissue with tumours for viewing and adding a radioactive element so they can view the tumour using an element tracer. In addition I took part in observing and noting down the impacts these tumours had on the surrounding blood vessel using a computer powered microscope. </p>

    <p> My part time retail job reaffirmed the value of time in such a fast paced environment especially with a team. Dealing with different situations as they arise without losing track of the main roles given to me each day was a part I had to adapt quickly to. </p>

    <p>  Volunteering at my local church helped me build my communication skills with all the various members consisting in a team so we could plan a good fundraiser. Without being directly told to I found myself creating a collaborative atmosphere for every team member to voice their thoughts on subjects. </p>
