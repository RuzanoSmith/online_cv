            <p>European arrival

            Portuguese, Dutch and French traders arrived on the south coast of China in the 1500s and Portugal set up a base in Macau, neighbouring Hong Kong.

            But in the 18th century China imposed restrictions on the Europeans in a bid to contain their influence.

            Britain was angered after an imperial edict banned its trade in opium from India to China, which had led to the spread of addiction.

            After Chinese authorities seized a vast haul of the drug, Britain attacked in 1840 and reached northern China, threatening Beijing, in the First Opium War.

            To make peace, China agreed to cede Hong Kong Island to Britain in 1841.

            The Kowloon peninsula followed in 1860 after a second Opium War and Britain extended north into the rural New Territories in 1898, leasing the area for 99 years.

            British rule

            Hong Kong was part of the British empire until 1997, when the lease on the New Territories expired and the entire city was handed back to China.</p>
